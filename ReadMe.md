## Database

The SQL scripts under `/database` define all database structures and test data.

Run the setup in your MySQL environment:
```bash
mysql -u root -p < database/base.sql
mysql -u root -p < database/insert.sql
```

Database connection configuration is in:
```
admin/dbconfig/dbconfig.php
```

Example content:
```php
<?php
$host = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$database = "fleet_management";
$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database);
?>
```
